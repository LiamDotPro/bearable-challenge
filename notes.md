Hello!

Firstly to run the application you can simply use expo `yarn start` and either a sim or expo go will do.

I made some additional choices while creating this application as follows:

1) Styled components, I think there useful for styling components and creates more readable code.
2) Styled system, I think it is a good way to style components in general and for speed in assignments it helps to have lots of generics
3) Redux Toolkit, I basically wanted to try slices and also to use redux toolkit for the reducers, it's also nice that reselct comes from there as well now.
